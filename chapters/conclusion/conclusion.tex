\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}


Each chapter of this thesis consists of an independent scientific study and includes its own detailed discussion. Consequently, this chapter provides a general summary and conclusion of the current PhD research. Moreover, it includes an overview of the limitation and challenges we needed to tackled during the project, as well as suggested future directions and contributions to continue this piece of work.

\section{General summary}

% overview of chapters and objectives

\section{Role of open-source tools and open science}

% open source, the benefits, tuxriders, education

\section{Challenges and limitations}

\subsection{Moving interface problems}

% defining BCs on an implicit interface

\subsection{High-performance computing and scaling}

%Building with different MPI implementations
%Inter-node communication
%Running parallel FF
%Mesh generation (parallel, sequential)
%Converting surface mesh to volume
%Scaling issues
%Memory issues
%Node types
%Visualization, GPU nodes
