\section{Introduction}


3D-printed orthopedic implants have been gaining  popularity in recent years due to the control this manufacturing technique gives the designer over the different design aspects of the implant \cite{Kumar2021,Yadav2020}. This technique allows manufacturing implants with material properties similar to bone, giving the implant designer the opportunity to address complications experienced after various surgeries, an example of which is the aseptic loosening of the implant after total hip arthroplasty (THA). The rate and quality of bone regeneration after implantation of orthopaedic implants depends greatly on the achieved mechanical stability. To restore proper function after implant loosening, the implant needs to be replaced. During these revision surgeries, some extra bone is removed along with the implant, further increasing the already present defects, and making it harder to achieve proper mechanical stability with the revision implant \cite{Luthringer2014}. A possible way to limit the increasing loss of bone is the use of biodegradable orthopedic implants that optimize long-term implant stability, in which part of the implant, like the acetabular cup shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cup_implant}, is made from biodegradable metals. This means that the biodegradable part of the implant will disappear and be replaced by newly formed bone during the implant's lifetime. Taking advantage of these implants needs to both optimize the implant such that stress shielding is minimized, and tune the implant degradation rate such that newly formed bone is able to replace the degrading metal in order to maintain a proper bone-implant contact. The hope is that such (partly) degradable implants will lead to a reduction in the size of the bone defects over time, making possible future revisions less likely and less complex.

\end{figure}

In this study, we focused on improving the long-term implant stability of patient-specific acetabular implants for large bone defects and tuning of their biodegradable behavior. To improve long-term implant stability, we implemented a topology optimization approach, in which a patient-specific finite element model of the hip joint with and without implant was derived from CT-scans to evaluate the performance of the designs during the optimization routine. The implant shape was generated using a lattice infilled structure based on the results of the performed topology optimization.

Developing a quantitative mathematical model of the degradation process is a proper solution for tuning the biodegradation and material release rate, allowing researchers to study the biodegradation behavior of any desired implant \textit{in silico} (in the computer) prior to conducting any \textit{in vitro} or \textit{in vivo} experiments. Developed mathematical models can be simulated using efficient numerical schemes such as the finite element method. The primary challenge here will be achieving a high numerical accuracy at the interface between the implant and surrounding tissue in the body as the interface plays an important role in the degradation phenomena. Increased accuracy means increased computational cost and resources (especially time), but high-performance computing (HPC) techniques can be used to overcome this challenge.



\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Topology optimization model}

For building the lattice structure, the in-house developed open-source tool ASLI \cite{Perez-Boerema2022} was used to create a triply periodic minimal surface based infill for the acetabular implant based on the output of a patient-specific topology optimization.

\subsection{Biodegradation model}




In this study, we developed a quantitative mathematical model to predict the biodegradation of magnesium-based implants. Magnesium (Mg) has been selected to start with due to its acceptable mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and contribution in osteoinductivity \cite{Agarwal2016}. The developed model captures the release of Mg ions, the formation of a protective film,  the dissolution of this film due to the presence of various ions in the surrounding environment, and change of pH. This was accomplished by deriving a system of nonlinear time-dependent reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) from the underlying oxidation-reduction reactions occurring during the biodegradation process of metallic materials in simulated body fluid. The level-set formalism was employed to track the movement of the biodegradation front between the implant and its surroundings. The equations were solved implicitly using the finite element method for spatial terms (with a 1st order Lagrange polynomial as the shape function) and backward-Euler finite difference method for temporal terms on an Eulerian mesh, implemented in the open-source PDE solver FreeFEM\cite{Hecht2012}. The details of this model can be found in our previous contribution \cite{Barzegari2021}. Two separate simulations were performed using two different diffusion coefficients as calibrated in our previous work to model the degradation behavior in non-buffered and buffered solutions.

In order to build the computational model, the resulting surface mesh of the topology optimization routine, consisting of \num{5347924} faces, was converted to a volume mesh and embedded in a cubic container that was to act as the environment during the biodegradation simulations. The conversion of the surface mesh was done using GMSH \cite{Geuzaine2009}, and the embedding process was carried out using the internal mesh engine of FreeFEM, called BAMG. The mesh was refined on the implant-environment interface to increase the numerical accuracy of the interface tracking model, leading to a final mesh with \num{45870053} elements. The mesh refinement process was handled using Mmg \cite{Dapogny2014} (and ParMmg \cite{balarac:hal-03344779}). Fig. \ref{fig:cup_model} shows the embedded cup model and a cross section of the final generated mesh, which was refined on the metal-solution interface.

\end{figure}

For dealing with a problem of this size and making the model capable of being scaled in large-scale computing systems, the model was implemented making use of the high-performance computing (HPC) techniques available in the FreeFEM language v4.10 and PETSc toolkit v3.16.1 \cite{petsc}. In this implementation, METIS and ParMETIS graph partitioners \cite{METIS1998} were used to decompose the mesh into various partitions, and then the partitioned mesh was distributed among available computing resources using the HPDDM preconditioner \cite{Jolivet2013}. Fig. \ref{fig:cup_decomposition} shows the decomposition of the computational mesh. Moreover, HYPRE BoomerAMG \cite{Falgout2002} preconditioner and GMRES iterative solver \cite{Saad1986} were used to solve the linear systems of equations obtained from applying the finite element discretization on the model. More details of the implementation can be found in \cite{Barzegari2022}.

\end{figure}

The simulation was carried out using 2,000 CPU cores with 16.5 TB of available memory on Dutch national supercomputer, Snellius. The simulation results, comprising of \num{95000} files with a total size of 148 GB, were visualized using a parallel client-server remote rendering approach in ParaView server v5.9.1 running on 128 CPU cores on the ARCHER2 supercomputer. 

In order to obtain the scaling behavior of the model in an HPC environment, strong and weak scaling tests were performed in the Snellius supercomputer. For the weak scaling test, in addition to the mesh with \num{45870053} elements, two more mesh files consisting of less elements were generated using the aforementioned procedure for embedding and refining the mesh. These models had \num{15989521} and \num{29035491}, respectively, to which the number of employed CPU cores were adjusted accordingly. The strong scaling test was carried out for all the three model sizes by varying the number of employed CPU cores from 60 to \num{9000}. 


\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Topology optimization of the acetabular implant}

The generated lattice structure of the implant, infilled by skeletal-gyroid unit cell type, is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:cup_optimization}. The volume fraction is varied during the topology optimization process to match the stiffness distribution required to maximize the tissue growth.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Biodegradation of the infilled implant}

Fig. \ref{fig:cup_degradation_rate} shows the mass loss during the biodegradation for simulations performed in buffered (low degradation rate) and non-buffered (high degradation) solutions. The mass loss is one of commonly-used indicators for the degradation rate, demonstrating that the biodegradation rate is much higher in the non-buffered solution. Loss of material over time was found to be in line with the values obtained in our previous study \cite{Barzegari2021}, showing that scaling the model in an HPC environment does not affect the quantitative predictions made by the model.

\caption[Biodegradation rate for the acetabular implant]{Rate of mass loss during the biodegradation of the porous acetabular implant in saline and buffered solutions.} \label{fig:cup_degradation_rate}
\end{figure}

From a qualitative point of view, visualizing the biodegradation results, depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:cup_degradation_visual} over time, shows that the acetabular implant degrades faster in the regions with higher porosity, i.e. the region with more exposed surface area to the environment. These regions have lower stiffness, which resulted in high porosity by being filled with TPMS unit cells having low volume fraction.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Scaling tests on the computational models}

The results of the strong scaling tests are plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:cup_strong_scaling}, which shows the solution time of individual comprising equations of the biodegradation model in a single time step versus the varying number of CPU cores. The strong scaling test shows that the optimal size for the distributed computing environment is \num{5000} CPU cores, above which no significant improvement in the execution time was observed in all the three tested problem size.

\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:cup_weak_strong} shows the results of the strong and weak scaling tests side by side. As can be seen in the weak scaling result, the model shows an ideal scaling behavior in environments with less than \num{1000} cores. With the number of CPU cores more than this, the system shows non-ideal behavior, as can be observed in strong scaling results, in which the addition of more CPU cores does not cause a linear drop in the execution time (wall time).

\section{Conclusions}

In this work, taking advantage of HPC techniques to simulate a large-scale 3D model led to a computational model capable of predicting the biodegradation behavior of an acetabular implant in high resolution. Results demonstrate the potential of the model to act as a tool for assessing and tuning the biodegradation properties of orthopedic  implants regardless of shape or complexity.
